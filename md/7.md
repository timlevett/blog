What a wonderful Sunday! This morning started pretty early with me getting up at 7am, it was time for the last F1 race of the season. Abu Dhabi (where the race is) seems like a wonderful place I will never visit. The race was pretty typical for this year. The two mercs up front, one Ferrari a ways back, and the other one starting from the second row. The highlights consisted of Vettel (the behind Ferrari) pushing his way through the field. Always neat to see some quality passing. Nico won, so that is 3 in a row for him. No surprise really.

After the race we just kind of chilled, which was really nice. We gathered around old photos of Cassi and her upbringing. It was really neat to see where this amazing person came from. We then watched some pregame NFL network stuff. I took a total of 2 naps during the football parts. hehe. I do enjoy watching football from time to time, but mostly when its a close game. 

I also started to do a little browsing for building a PC. Not sure exactly what I'm going to go with yet, but its going to be sweet whatever it is. My goal is to have a good enough machine that I don't have to upgrade for at least 3 years, but still upgradeable. Any suggestions are welcomed.

Tomorrow we fly back home. I'm excited to go back, but it was fun meeting Cassi's family. They are very warm and welcoming people. 

I'm going to try to blog more often, now that I have this minimalist blogging plateform. :)
