Happy Thanksgiving everyone! This t-giving I'm traveling to Delaware to visit Cassi's family. I'm having a wonderful time. I am very thankful for such a wonderful dinner and time with family. Many laughs, lots of eats, and a all-around relaxing time. I also miss my family during this holiday. I chatted with my mom and they are hosting at there newly renovated house. I'm excited to see that when I go home next.

On our flight out here we got to ride in the smallest plane in the AA group.

How cute is that? The flight was fine, just couldn't believe it was so little.

Anyway, just a quick post to wish everyone a happy holiday!
