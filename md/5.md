Wow, it snowed, a lot! Over the past 2 days we got about 6 inches of snow out of no where. I knew it was going to stick, so I planned on setting up my fat tire bike for a trip. I took off and went through the Ice Age trail over to Military Ridge Trail. I ended up at Quarry Ridge mountain bike tracks. I did 2 loops of the track and made my way back. I saw a lot of great sites, enjoyed the quietness of the snow, and saw some fellow fat bikers. Below are some pics I took and my Strava stats. I had my GoPro with me, but it died. Turns out you have to charge these things. Whomp whomp.

_Minor blog update:_ This is my first post using [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). Markdown (md for short) makes writing blog posts a heck of a lot easier. I'm enjoying it so far. I write the posts in [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the md previewer package. I'm using [angular-md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-md) for its `<md>` directive. Under the hood, it uses [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked).
