This post really has nothing to do with cats, just couldn't think of anything and Otis was giving me the stare. I updated the blog, mostly minor things, but here is a short list.

+ Created a `<breadcrumbs>` directive. Utilized directive in all subpages.
+ Dropped usage of the `md-subheader`. I kind of liked it but scrolling was laggy and I didn't like it
+ Revamped post lookup for the focused page. Now you can look for a post via id, name with spaces, or name with _ instead of spaces. _Example:_ You can hit post 1 via `/post/1`, `/post/hello_world`, and for legacy support `/post/Hello%20World`. This will provide for a better makes the URL's prettier.
+ Deleted a lot of old pages that I didn't need anymore.
+ Added in a light grey background to help the cards stick out a bit.
+ Updated material angular to 1.0.4 (latest available on CDN).
+ Based on feedback, I made the header of the sidebar clickable (it collapses the sidebar).

I'm coming up with a list of things to blog about. Until then, enjoy the updates.

Just so this is a well rounded post, here is a picture of a cat:
