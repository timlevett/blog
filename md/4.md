I added some features as of late to my blog. I revamped the home page to have a better subtitle feel. I tested on mobile too so fixed some issues there. I also added detail pages. Now if you click the header on any post it'll bring you to a page with just that post. The post URL is really a search on the JSON in the backend. It does a filter, then grabs the first entry in the returned array. Think of it as \"close enough\" browsing. My next goal is to setup a markdown template. In theory I should be able to just have a directory with .md files and my blog will display the content. After that, I'll probably be done for a while. Holidays and all that. Excited, tomorrow is supposed to be the first snow fall. Can't wait to get the fat bike out. If I don't post, happy holidays!
