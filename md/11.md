So I left a tid-bit about my 2016 goals out, didn't want to ruin the surprise. It's not really a goal, but more something that I'm very much looking forward to in the new year. I asked my love Cassi to marry me and she said yes! Eek! We are not sure exactly when we will get married, might be next spring, but nothing planned. For now we are just looking forward to taking the next step in our relationship. I couldn't be happier. The day after we got engaged, we went out to [Pancake Cafe](http://www.pancakecafe.com/) (so good) then we took a nature hike at a near by trail. We took [some wonderful shots](https://goo.gl/photos/fjPDr89VrmkLnDVZ7), enjoy! I'm really looking forward to the new year.
