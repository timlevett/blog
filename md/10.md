### Redesigning MyUW Datastore

Currently we call uPortal's API to get a list of portlets/apps that people can add to their layout. This call takes about 7 - 20 seconds depending on the complexity of your group management setup.  This is obviously an issue.

We only have about 200 entries, and about 40 groups. The cross reference really shouldn't be much time.

Currently our group structure is a tree, so you can do group inheritance. For other teams using uPortal that might seem necessary, but for MyUW its is overkill.

My thought for redesigning the data store is 2 fold. One, provide a mechanism to look up which groups you are in. These groups should just be flat list of groups, or come from an external datastore. Two, provide a list of entities with a quick/fast filter.

Incomplete Draft...
