Every year I write a post reflecting what I did in the current year, and my aspirations for the year to come. This is that post for 2015 transitioning to 2016.  Looking back at [my 2015 post](http://lifewithtimtim.blogspot.com/2014/12/2014-was-relaxing-onward-to-2015.html) I had some great goals. I accomplished most of these goals, but I won't relive everything in this post.

I had some pretty amazing trips! I visited Door county for a weekend for the 1/2 marathon. It is a cute little town. I went to Florida to meet my new niece Elle, she is adorbs. It was really good to see my sister and her family. I went to Texas (twice) with my good friend Ben to watch the MotoGP race and the Formula 1 race. Both times it rained, but we had a blast. I hiked at Devils Lake, more on that later ;). I ran the Chicago marathon which was amazing, such a fun event. I also took a trip to the east coast to visit Cassi's family for Thanksgiving. That was also a super fun trip. Looking back on it, 2015 was a great travel year.  

I also had a lot of changes that happened in-town this year. I started dating and fell in love with my now girlfriend Cassi. We are like peas and carets. She is so amazing, our personalities work very well together. We enjoy each others company.  I also moved twice, first from a 2 bedroom apartment downtown to a 1 bedroom in the same building. Then, Cassi and I took the next step and moved in together this past fall. It has been amazing, I'm excited to see what the future brings.
